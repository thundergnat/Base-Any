2020-11-14 v0.1.1 - Fix typos, enhance some error messages, fix off-by-one error in threshold reporting.
                    Expand documentation for custom digits sets, show code example. Minor tweaks throughout.
                    Add some more testing for custom digit set operations.

2020-11-13 v0.1.0 - Fairly large changes semi breaking changes. Added built in capability to easily change out 
                      digit set. Added routines set-digits() and reset-digits() to easily load / unload custom
                      digit sets. Required fairly extensive modifications thoughout. Could no longer pass bases
                      2-36 to inbuilt operators as the digit glyphs may change, so now likely returns results
                      _slightly_ different in the lesser precision from inbuilt operators for Rationals / Nums.
                    Modified testing to no longer test against inbuilts, add some excercising for loading
                      / unloading custom digit sets. 

2020-05-26 v0.0.7 - Limit precision while testing small base conversions. Getting ocassional failures.

2020-04-26 V0.0.6 - Detect and fail when trying to convert Inf or Nan.
                    Add tests for Inf and NaN.
                    Add comment to Base::Any::Digits explaining how glyphs were selected.
                    Expanded glyph set (from v0.0.5) allows for imaginary radicies up to ±67i; adjust limits accordingly.
                    Various minor formatting / style tweaks

2020-04-25 V0.0.5 - Made from-base() ignore case in bases -2 <-> -36 (similar to positive bases).
                    Added tests for ignore case in bases -2 <-> -36.
                    Trapped errors when trying to from-base() with out-of-range characters.
                    Test for out-of-range characters.
                    Detect and test for too many dec\b\b\bradicimal points.
                    Expanded glyph set a bit (actually, realized that I had miscounted while... ⬋⬋⬋)
                    Added testing for out-of-range and threshold sized positive/negative radicies.

2020-04-24 V0.0.4 - Bug fix for array/hash encoding zero values incorrectly.
                    Add tests for zero encoding.
                    Made positive and negative encoding testing a little more forgiving of imprecision.
                      Was getting sporatic failures in least significant digits of converted Rats.

2020-04-24 V0.0.3 - Bug fix for array encoding negative numbers with positive radix.
                    Clean up and rewrite major portions of the Docs. 
                    Add testing for imaginary base numbers.
                    Add testing for array and hash encoded numbers. 
                    Add underscore capability for numeric strings.
                    Add tests for numeric strings containing underscore.

2020-04-23 V0.0.2 - Mostly Doc fixes. Add build status image, fix typos, Expand docs a bit.

2020-04-23 V0.0.1 - Initial version. Bugs, but mostly works.
